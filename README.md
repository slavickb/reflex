# reflex
A smol reaction time game, you need python 3 and tkinter to run it
<br>
Anytime you press Escape, the game closes (or you can just close it with your preferred shortcut like Alt+F4 or that little cross which you might or might not have in a corner of the window) :)

### To do:
  - clean the code up
  - change variable names to english

## Structure of the game:
  - Reflex - reaction time only
  - Numpad game
  - Aimlabs - aiming game

### Reaction
  - to start a game, you just press a spacebar
  - after a random time, the button turns red
  - you can either click it or hit the "1" key on your keyboard
  - the button turns green for a second and your time is shown on the screen
  - after a second, the button turns white again and you can start it again

### Numpad
  - there's a grid of 9 buttons, just like the numpad on your keyboard
  - after a random time, a random one of the buttons turn red and you have to press the right key or click it
  - there's no penalty for hitting a different key, the only thing that matters is how much time it takes you to hit the correct one

### Aimlabs
  - there's a huge grid of buttons without numbers (so that more of them fit inside the window)
  - after a random time, a random one of them turns red and you have to click it
  - again, the game only measures the time it takes you to hit the right button
